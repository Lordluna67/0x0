<h1>The Blobfish History</h1>
<h2>By Daniel Buchanan and Haden Cunningham</h2>

<p>The blobfish might just look like a regular species to the naked eye but they are much, much, MUCH more...</p>

<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>
<p>At BT infinity, the first higher god swirled in nothingness. It was called the Infinity Frige. The Infinity Fridge was something in nothing. The impossible that is possible. So, it exploded., But by the sheer power, it tore apart. Splitting in to two worlds, one something, and one nothing. In between those two worlds was a gateway. That gateway was called Lorem Ipsum, the second higher god. It was the god of death, pain, and eternal chaos. Lorem Ipsum was lonely and asked the Infinity Fridge to make somthing to help, so the Infinity Fridge split agai. This time it formed The Void, and spread it over that nothingness. After that the Infinty Fridge made Mortem, the third, and most powerful higher god, which made the moon. Then the Infinity Fridge made Time and Fate, those where the brothers of elder. After that, from he of depths of nothingness came Cell Narox. The 6th and final higher god. Time and Narox created two beings, Rick and Unknown, the first gods.</p>

  <p> Rick was the god of destruction. While Unknown was the god of creation. So they were natural enemies. Meanwhile, Mortem wanted to be king instead of the Infinity Fridge, so Mortem raged war. After a long and destructive war, the other higher gods put Mortem to sleep, and put him in the nothingness beneath the void wrapped in chains. Rick and Unknown were fighting like they always do, but Cell Narox was in-between the two, and when they collided together, the blast created the first lords called Void People. One of the Void People, the leader, was named Draco. He became Unknowns apprentice, he created something within the void called the indeverse. But then he also created beings these beings were the Pears, Eggnogians, Blobfish, Bacterium, and the Catfish. All of these creatures, or species, settled on different planets, but Bacterium met a fauna named Grass, and together made the Capybaras and Cheeseburgers. The Cheeseburgers lived on the planet Cheese, the Blobfish, Bananas, and Pears all lived on the planet earth. Bananas were sons of Rick, Pears and Blobfish were sons of the Void People.The Catfish lived on the moon, but the Void People wanted the Catfishes treasure in the core of the moon. It was called the Energy Capsule.</p>
</p>
<h3>Part 1, Chapter 2</h3>

  

  <p>“They didn’t even use the living spray from the elixir pistol on the time rip, that would totally heal the air.” Well that triggered Bob to do exactly that. As he closed the time rip, he saw 2 things: A penguin falling out of the time rip, and someone talking to a void person. That someone was none other than Richard, in his void person form. “You cannot fail me, or else it would lead to lethal death for you, and all of your loved ones. And the blobfish, kill them all, except for the one with glowing eyes. Bob, is it?” the void person said to Richard. “Yes. I will over exceed my tasks, Master D. I will make sure to capture Bob” said Richard. “We will see… And please… Call me Master Draco” said the void person as he looked at Richard in demise. It seemed if this whole war was a distraction so then Richard could plunge the infinity shard into the moon. He teleported himself right where Richard was, but on accident portaled both on the other side of the moon.Meanwhile, an admiral of the blobfish empire had recently became a lord. He was called Lord Luna. He possessed very powerful abilities, and found himself entering The Great Splattered War. His intelligence made him know that the whole thing was just a distraction, and went right to the moon. So now he sees a blobfish, and a banana in void person form standing on a bridge above sharp ferrofluid, which wraps around you like tentacles. “RICHARD!” Bob said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.” “Oh but you see, I WANT it this way” Bob lands the first hit, striking him with the soundwave sword. “HAHAHAHA RICHARD, TAKE THA- No…”. “YES YES YES BOB, DON’T FORGET WHO GAVE ME THE SWORD OF AMETHITE” Of course, Bob gave Richard the mythical weapon. Both strike each other's weapons, again and again.</p>

  

  <p> Then Bob suddenly freezes. Whispers go through his mind. Your a failure… You will never succeed… All of these thoughts came from Richard’s lowering self-esteem spell. While Lord Luna was watching all of the events take place, he decided to live up to his name and became Master of the Moon. He was gonna do that by sneaking off to get the shard and restore it to the fridge. Richard was distracted by Lord Luna coming closer and closer, and overtime the self-esteem spell wore off. Finally, Bob was present, and while Richard was distracted, Bob picked up the soundwave sword and split his body in half. Richard was furious. One half of his body fell into the ferrofluid. “BOB! YOU WILL REGRET THIS!”  He suffered in pain while the ferrofluid wrapped around him, cutting him apart. His body eventually sunk to the core of the moon. The other half of Richard’s body contained his soul, desperate for power. Richard possessed the infinity fridge. Now you might be saying “I thought Bob ate the fridge” Well Bob did eat the fridge, but Richard possessed the fridge INSIDE Bob’s body. Luckily, Lord Luna had the infinity shard, so the fridge wasn’t powered. But Richard’s pulse was too strong for Bob’s body, and sadly, that was the end of Bob’s journey. The pulse EXPLODED Bob’s body. He then collected Bob’s skin, for whatever reason he had. That wasn’t it. Richard was still possessing Bob, and was able to live from the explosion. He picked up the two swords and collided them together, crushing them into fragments, consuming their power. Richard, then making a portal, closing it, and leaving Lord Luna, all alone, on the Moon. Ever since then Lord Luna has been filled with guilt, knowing that he could’ve stopped the blobfish from suffering for many years, but didn’t. Suddenly all the bananas had an allergic reaction from the moonlight and turned into SALMONS and disappeared to follow Richard to his new base. But what happened to the other half of Richard’s body? Well, after it fell into the ferrofluid, he was in severe condition. He would’ve died if he didn’t sink to the core of the Moon. You see, the core of the Moon is special, because it contains the genius invention of a catfish, called the Energy Capsule. It was used from the duke of catfish, many years ago to escape from the void people, (eventually creating the bananas and cheeseburgers) invaders of their home, the Moon. They went to war, catfish winning the initial fight, but losing at the end. As the catfish were rejected to a different planet, there was one catfish who refused to leave his home, the duke of catfish, who was shoved to the core of the Moon. He created the Energy Capsule. The idea of the Energy Capsule was to have millions of energy captured in the capsule. With so much energy in one point, it would have to blow, sending a giant beam of energy through the Moon, making someone go at an alarming speed, getting to their destination in seconds.</p>

  

  <p>And Richard fell into the beam of energy, rushing so fast that he could not keep his physical void person form, and from how soft his body was, all of it got disintegrated from the energy, and soon his whole body was skeletal. His bones would of chipped away too if he didn’t crash into another moon. This moon, which unlike the other, was undiscovered. At least, HE thought it was undiscovered. A void person was on the other moon. It was Master Draco. But what would Master Draco be doing on a distant moon? Well, he was planning to take it over, until he saw Richard practically engulfed in the crust. “Richard? Is that you?” “You seem to be nearly unconscious” said Draco. Draco was no normal void person though. He had tons of infinity shards stuck on to his body, and one managed to fall into Richards head. This crushed through his skull, and into his brain. Suddenly, all of the information in his mind went into the shard. Infinity shards are very contagious, and 3 more spreaded on him. This healed his head, turning it into a half moon. Speaking of his body, all that radiation from the energy made his limbs and torso deteriorate and fall off. His soul was transported to an infinity shard, which was starting to crack. Soon, that soul took over for his body. Draco gave him a cape, and soon, his other half of his body came out of a portal, and once the two touched, they became one. During the following events, once Richard left, the blobfish thought Lord Luna had defeated him, and crowned Luna their new monarch after Bob’s death. When he went back on Earth, Luna saw the penguin that fell out the time rip. The penguin introduced himself, telling him his name was Pecko. He said he was from the future (3 days after this) and that Richard created him. Richard created all birds, but somehow, penguins and puffins substantially rose to high intelligence. In fact, they were a bit smarter than Richard! Of course, this made Richard jealous, so he assembled a plan. You see, penguins were smarter than Richard, but that was really not the case for puffins. The puffins did not have much care, unlike the penguins who were defending both animals. Richard observed that puffins got annoyed of the penguins always pushing them to help and making them do work. So Richard’s plan was to have the puffins make a deal with him, where his army of salmon would protect them and treat them like kings in exchange for the penguins. The puffins loved this idea, and the aerial birds sent gusts of wind against the penguins. They underestimated their strength, though, as each penguin sent icicles flying toward the puffins, persisting through the harsh breeze. Soon, the penguins were victorious, forcing the puffins to a dungeon. Luckily for the puffins, that dungeon contained of Richard’s forces. Richard knew this would happen, and told he puffins he would give them a more powerful body. One by one, a salmon came through a door, chasing after them. The puffins ran for their lives, but because of lack of exercise, they fell tired in their dashes. The salmon revolution began, as a single touch infected any living thing into a salmon. They all surged over to the penguins, and while each one had the same effect, Pecko plummeted into the rip, (time rips spawn in different time zones) and before the goo consumed him, he fell onto the ground during the war. Richard made Pecko’s species extinct, and was growing his army as they spoke, so he could get back at Luna.</p>

  

  <p>Meanwhile, Richard and his army of salmon where at the core of the moon, Draco observing. “Wow… Turning my army into salmons? How is this supposed to help us against the brilliant catfish army? They have 10x better resources than they had before!“, sulked Draco. “I was thinking maybe we could battle with Lord Luna instead.” Richard suggested. Draco gave a loud, deep, sigh “I see what you’ve been doing… You’re my apprentice, not my ruler.”. Draco gave Richard a viscous stare, beaming right in his eyes. During that, Lord Luna and Pecko rushed over to team up with the catfish and capybaras, and with the tracker the catfish made, they found Richard’s base and broke in. The two dueled once again, but then, Lord Luna dodged Richard’s new scythe’s jab, and crushed the spirit-filled weapon to pieces. Then Draco spoke up. “Bravo. Wow, I didn’t think you were that strong Mr. Luna, but now you have to face me.” Draco gave Luna a wicked a glare, then suddenly striking him, the hits rising exponentially per second. Draco was dueling with loads of ferrofluid, covering his hands. The horrid fluid started wrapping around Luna. Then, the ferrofluid suddenly shot back towards Draco. “AHHHH, why you little imbecci-” Pecko was using the ice force on Draco, freezing down on the floor. Laughs echoed across the room. It was Richard. Draco exclaimed, “RICHARD, GET THE PENGUIN AND LUNA OUT, NOW!” “Draco, let me take control here” Smirking, Richard opened a portal. In a flash, Draco was shoved into the portal, being transported to a Towers Trash Compactor, a nerdy place on the moon, and was instantly vaporized in the incinerator. “You’re next!” But for some reason, he saw that Pecko was - giddy with delight? All of a sudden, the infinity fridge had fallen on Richard. He was pinned to the ground! Shock had filled everybody’s stomach, except for Pecko. He had a catfish take the infinity fridge from the Moon and drop it above Richard. “But I thought Richard possessed the fridge” Well he was possessing the fridge, but once he fused with his other half, the fridge wasn’t being possessed anymore, so it was on the “other moon.” But in Richard’s last moment of life, he had taken the shards plunged into his head and engulfed it in the power dispenser of the fridge. BUT WHAT COULD THIS MEA-</p>

<h3>Part 2, Chapter 1</h3>

<p>
It was a normal day on Earth, where Pecko and Lord Luna were arguing about if the Moon was made out of cheese.“IT OBVIOUSLY IS!!!! Why do you think the catfish wanted to live there!? BECAUSE IT WAS MADE OF CHEESE”“Pecko, I own The Moon. I should and do know what my own moon is made out of. Plus, I have the blobfish making the Moon almost fully robotic. It’s safer that way. And as for the ferrofluid, it’s being held in glass bubbles. ”“Stop being doltish. Of course it’s made of cheese” Said the nerdy catfish with an extreme lisp.“Anyway, I have made an invention that allows you to go through the black goo and venture into the void. I call it the Venturererererererererer.“That name is worse than when that bird was choking on 4 dead rats.” Said Pecko.“DID YOU NOT HEAR WHAT HE JUST SAID!!!! CLEAN YOUR EARS, HEAD IN THERE!!!” Luna screamed. Pecko slapped the Venturererererererererer out the catfish’s hands, that appeared to look like a backpack, out of the catfish’s hands and jumped into the fridge. But when he arrived, he was greeted by a familiar face, much like a past foe. Richard was here. It seemed he had started a civilization with the salmon inside the void. “Long time, no see.” Richard chuckled. “BUT YOU DIED-” “Yes, Pecko, thank you for reminding me. But my soul still has powers, like talking into my salmons’ minds to bring me your rich resources, and… possession.” Richard’s smile grew larger and larger. “I don’t know how you’re in this fridge, how you survived, or what your plans are, but I’m gonna destroy this fridge, even if I have to drag your face across every surface of your little monarchy.” Pecko started to think if he had physical contact with Richard, his dad. They walked up to each other. Then Pecko landed a hit, which cracked off his rocky hand. But this also came with bad news. He could feel a ghost. He held his broken hand.</p>


<p>Of course, Richard didn’t seem too happy. Pecko ran. And ran. And right when he could almost reach the door, Richard appeared in front of him. Richard grabbed a tiny piece of amethite, or amethyst from the Moon, and gently put it into Pecko. He was now under Richard’s control. But this piece seemed different. It came from the body of a blobfish that they were trying to reincarnate. But why would they want to bring a blobfish back to life? For now, this question is not solved. Pecko was back at Earth and out the void.“Hey Pecko! How was it in there? I can survive the extreme pressure, and I’ve been there before, so I didn’t really want to go. Sorry about that.” “No, no Luna, don’t apologize. I know you’ve been there tons of times… BUT SO HAVE I!” Pecko suddenly rushed up to Luna and made crystal daggers from thin air, trying to pierce him.  “PECKO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” “What has to be done, Luna, and now, I’m completing the first step.” He then touched Lord Luna’s sword, making it disintegrate. “RICHARD!?.” “What a guess, eh? The fact you really thought I died though, that’s the crazy thing.” Luna was reminded how he died, when the infinity fridge fell onto Richard.  He still remembered though, that he grabbed a piece of amethite (amethyst from the moon) that was engulfed down to his brain, then launched it into the fridge. And, for some reason, that was making a lot of sense to him now. His soul was captured into those crystals after he fell in the ferrofluid, and now, with his amethite in the fridge, his soul was living there the whole time.Luna gasped. They both teleported to the fridge, sweat gushing down their backs as they tried to grab it first. Then Lord Luna tripped Possessed Pecko. He saw him slowly fall down, next to the fridge. But, the piece of Infinity in the fridge tore some skin off Pecko, and with his adrenaline going wild, Richard soon lost control of Pecko’s body. After that luna and pecko were on the moon planning their comeback…</p>  

  

  <p>Pecko, what did you see when you were in the void? I saw a big island and a temple with a statue of Rick. hmmm ok alright I think I know where that was. Where? asked pecko. “On the moon,” WHAT but luna, we are on the moon right now! I know, but there is a moon in every dimension, so that means we have to go through the hut of cheesy. Later in the void pecko and luna arrive at the hut of the great seer, cheesy… Luna, why does that name sound familiar? Because it is. Cheesy was the leader of the cheeseburgers and then he got sucked up into the infinity fridge so now he is in the void dimension. As they raped the door of cheesy the seer’s house the void suddenly was filled with a bright light and then faded…luna saw cheesy before, but not like this. He was all ragged and torn up ( probably the practical joke they played on him earlier in his life) and one of his eyes glowed with all the colors of the fourth dimension. Pecko’s mind suddenly flashed back to when richard stuck the shard into him, here was the other shard. But what could this mean? But pecko had no time to dwell on this because just then richard appeared at the edge of the hut and literally JUMPED OFF THE CLIFF OF THE VOID but suddenly they could all hear a laugh, the laugh of a void titan. Then the void titan, with richard in his hand YEITED richard into the nether spac-or whatever was beyond the void, which gave luna and pecko some time. “Luna” said cheesy, you have come a far way and I will give you a solution. He paused and handed luna a scroll and teleported away, leaving the scroll and his glowing eye.Luna and pecko, now at the moon, were studying the scroll and on the inside it said “At the beginning, after unknown and rick destroyed cell narox, there were four weapons, the scythe of rick and the trident of blobgod remained in the owner's hand, but the heritage icicle got passed down through the generations of rick and the moon axe were passed down from the generations of blobgod.</p>

  

  <p>Then there was a prophecy about the weapons.


One day there will be four, these four heroes will be the true heirs of the great two and the wicked one… One: Bob, he would be the heir of blobgod but then he died and with him died the location of the trident.Two: Richard, he would be the heir of rick and would father twins and then become the True heir of rick. Three: Lord luna, would be the true heir of blobgod after bob had died, shagolotha de logo la mortem la luna heer. Four: Ethier Pecko, smarticus, or sliminus, the brother of pecko, destin to ethier bring a end to the world or destroy the 𓃀𓃭𓅱𓃀𓎼𓅱𓂧.

</p>

  <p>So then, Pecko and Lord Luna made their way into the void and to the island where the gateway to Lorem Ipsum resided. It was called the Poop Hole. Around the temple were four slots, for the four weapons. When one being was placed in the center of the viewing platform, and each weapon was in place, the being would be gifted a full healing and made master of one of the four weapons. All the other weapons would go to the ones that brought them there. Lord luna having already known the location of two of the weapons, started to grab pecko and teleport there. The first weapon was the Scythe Of Rick, it was located in the Temple Of Rick in Lorem Ipsum. The problem was that most people that venture into Lorem Ipsum never make it out, soooo. Lord Luna and Pecko jumped into the Poop Hole. They materialized inside a peculiar room, which had four doorways that led into darkness. Lord Luna, having been there before, knew that, this was a test of patience, or of skill. He took out his war axe and, pecko following suit, took out his icicle. They both blasted energy at the top of the room where there was a symbol of a soldier. The soldier became bigger and dropped down from the ceiling to confront the duo. Lord Luna had chosen strength. They first tried to attack the warrior strait on, but quickly found out that was a bad move. Lord Luna reached for his sword, but before he even touched the hilt, he was lying on the floor, being crushed by the huge warrior. Suddenly the entire warrior turned to ice and burst into shards. “Pecko, nice job!” said Lord Luna as the part of the ceiling where the warrior came from dropped away, revealing a path upward. Throughout the rest of the maze, there were many tests and quizzes like this, but at the end, Lord Luna and Pecko found the Scythe and made a rift portal to the moon. On the way, Lord Luna told Pecko where the second weapon was.</p>
